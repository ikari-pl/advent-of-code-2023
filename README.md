# Advent of code 2023 

This repo is an excercise to remind myself whether I love or hate good old BASIC. In the future it might be extended with tests on retro computers, and/or more modern, and much cleaner implementations.

# BASIC?

It's related to a post I am writing for RetroFun.PL - digging into what was good and bad about the language. 

For this excercise, the tasks 01-03 are implemented in BBC BASIC, with some restrictions:
* trying not to use more than 48KB of RAM
* trying not to use keywords that weren't accessible on the 80s 8-bits - no procedures, no structs, no magic
